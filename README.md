### üéØ Project Aim

The journey through an engineering degree is filled with choices, but often lacks a clear, consolidated guide on how to translate academic knowledge into a successful career. Students frequently struggle to understand the vast array of job roles available, the specific skills required for each, and the logical steps to acquire them.

**Guidance Hub** was created to solve this problem. It serves as a centralized, step-by-step guide that demystifies career paths across all major engineering disciplines. By providing detailed, hierarchical roadmaps, the platform empowers students to make informed decisions, and build a solid foundation for their professional future with confidence and clarity.

### ‚ú® Features

* **Comprehensive Roadmap Structure:** The core of the application is a deeply nested content system that guides users from a general **Branch** (e.g., Computer Engineering) to a specialized **Domain** (e.g., Software & Web Development), then to a specific **Job Role** (e.g., Frontend Developer), and finally through a detailed timeline of **Roadmap Steps**.
* **Dynamic Content Management:** All content, including branches, domains, job roles, and roadmap steps, is managed entirely through the Django Admin Panel. This allows for easy updates, maintenance, and expansion without touching the source code.
* **User Authentication and Profiles:** A complete and secure system for user registration, login, and logout. Each user has a personal profile where they can add and update their details, including their full name, academic information, and a profile picture.
* **Modern and Responsive UI:** The entire website is built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional, and fully responsive design that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It features a rich user interface with a dynamic stardust background and a light/dark mode theme selector.
